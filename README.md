Taxi Order Prediction Model
Introduction
This project aims to train and evaluate a predictive model for a taxi company to forecast the number of taxi orders at airports. The model utilizes a time series dataset containing historical taxi order data, with the goal of accurately predicting the number of orders for the next hour. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric is employed for evaluating the model's performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided in the file taxi.csv. It consists of the following columns:

datetime: Date and time (in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format).
num_orders: Number of taxi orders.
Preparation
Initialization
The necessary libraries and modules are imported, including pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.

Load and Inspect Data
The dataset is loaded, indexed by the datetime column, and resampled to hourly intervals. A brief overview of the data is displayed, showing the first few rows and the data types.

Analysis
Trend and Rolling Mean
To identify trends in the data, rolling means are calculated using different window sizes (1 day, 7 days, and 14 days). The plots show a gradual increase in the number of taxi orders over time.

Seasonality
Seasonality is examined by decomposing the data for the months of March and August, revealing consistent daily spikes in the number of orders.

Auto vs. Partial Autocorrelation Function
Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions are plotted to observe the influence of lag features on model training. Both plots suggest significant correlations with preceding time points, particularly on a 24-hour cycle.

Feature Engineering
Features such as month, day, day of week, and lag features (representing past order counts) are extracted from the dataset. Additionally, a rolling mean feature with a one-week window size is created to capture trends.

Training and Evaluation
The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. Various models are trained and evaluated:

Linear Regression: Serves as the baseline model.
Decision Tree Regressor: Default model and tuned with hyperparameters.
Random Forest Regressor: Default model and tuned with hyperparameters.
Testing
The best-performing model (Random Forest Regressor) is evaluated on the test set using the tuned hyperparameters.

Conclusion
The project concludes with observations on model performance and potential areas for improvement, such as reducing overfitting and refining feature engineering. Recommendations for future iterations include incorporating external features and re-evaluating feature selection techniques.
